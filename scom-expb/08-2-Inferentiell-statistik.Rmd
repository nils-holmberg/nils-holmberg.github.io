## 8.2 Inferentiell statistik {#sec8.2}

Här kommer nåt om causal inference. In statistical hypothesis testing a type I error is the rejection of a true null hypothesis (also known as a \"false positive\" finding or conclusion), while a type II error is the non-rejection of a false null hypothesis (also known as a \"false negative\" finding or conclusion

\[1\]). Much of statistical theory revolves around the minimization of one or both of these errors, though the complete elimination of either is a statistical impossibility for non-deterministic algorithms.
